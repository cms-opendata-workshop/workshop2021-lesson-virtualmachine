## Downloading VirtualBox

VirtualBox is a free, open source and multiplatform hypervisor application to run virtual machines.  The latest version is `6.1.22` and is available for most platforms at the VirtualBox [download](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) site. Note that you will need administrative permissions on your machine in order to install it.

> The latest tested version of VirtualBox working with this CMS-specific CernVM image is `6.1.10`. Pick that one if you have troubles with the latest version. The full history of VirtualBox versions is available on a [different page](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds).

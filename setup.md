title: Setup
---
> Before you begin, please consider working with [Docker containers](https://cms-opendata-workshop.github.io/workshop2021-lesson-docker) instead. Actually, **we strongly recommend that**.  While virtual machines are fine and easy to work with, the container technology will provide a more robust setup for this workshop.
>
> If you experience problems with clipboard sharing between your host machine and your VM, the [text dump file](files/lessonDump.txt) of the lesson might be of help. You can download this file directly in your VM using, e.g., the `wget` command, and follow along to copy the necessary commands directly from the text file.
>
> Finally, please remember that you will find simple <strong style="color: red;">work assignments that must be submitted</strong> using our [assignment form](https://forms.gle/DDboG1MCcSNRBRHFA); you have to sign in and <strong style="color: red;">click on the submit button</strong> in order to save your work.  You can come back to edit the form at any time.

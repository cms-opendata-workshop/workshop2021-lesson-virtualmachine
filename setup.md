title: Setup
---
> Before you begin, consider working with [Docker containers](https://cms-opendata-workshop.github.io/workshop2021-lesson-docker) instead.  While virtual machines are perfectly fine and easy to work with, the container technology provides a lighter, more robust setup, particularly for large-scale processing.
>
> If you experience problems with clipboard sharing between your host machine and your VM, the [text dump file](../files/lessonDump.txt) of the lesson might be of help. You can download this file directly in your VM using, e.g., the `wget` command, and follow along to copy the necessary commands directly from the text file.

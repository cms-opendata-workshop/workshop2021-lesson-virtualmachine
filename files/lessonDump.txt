***** The need for VMs *****
CMS open data and legacy data, even though still exciting and full of research
potential, are already a few years old. Because of the rapidly evolving
technologies, the computing environments that were used to analyze these data
are already ancient compared to the current, bleeding edge ones.
Therefore, in order to maintain our ability to study these data, we have to
rely on technologies that help us preserve adequate computer environments. One
way of doing this is by using virtual machines.
In simple words, a virtual_machine is an emulation of a computer system that
can run within another system. The latter is usually known as the host.
***** Open data releases, CMSSW versions and operating systems *****
CMS open data from our 2010 release can be studied using CMSSW_4_2_8, a version
of the CMSSW software that used to run under Scientific Linux CERN 5 (slc5)
operating system. Likewise, open data from our 2011/2012 release used
CMSSW_5_3_32 under Scientific Linux CERN 6 (slc6).
The virtual machines that are used to analyze these data, therefore, need to
consider all these compatibility subtleties. They have to offer the correct
operating system so the right version of CMSSW can be used to manipulate the
dataset of interest.
***** Virtual machine images *****
In practical terms, a virtual machine image is a computer file that has all the
right ingredients to create a virtual computer inside a given host by the
process of virtualization. This file, however, needs to be decoded and run by a
virtual machine interpreter, usually known as hypervisor, which runs on the
host machine. The hypervisor we are going to use in this lesson is the
Oracleâs VirtualBox.
***** CMS VM images *****
The most current images for CMS open data usage are described separately in the
CERN Open Portal site for 2010 and 2011/2012. In later episodes we will be
using the latter image file.
***** Advantages and disadvantages of using VMs *****
For the end user, VMs really look and feel like a physical machine, so working
with them is easy and very convenient. The CMS VMs, in particular, come
equipped with the ROOT framework (although with an older version), CMSSW and
CVMFS access, all the goodies you need to start analyzing data right away.
However, VMs are usually heavy and take up a lot of the host resources, which
can affect performance. Also, it is more difficult to run batch jobs (large
scale processing) with them.
     ***** Key Points *****
         * A virtual machine is an emulation of a computer system that can
           run within another host system.
         * A hypervisor is a program that creates virtual machines from
           virtual machine image files and runs them virtually.
         * Virtual machines can be used to run over CMS open data in a
           very intuitively way. However, they take up a lot of resources,
           are less efficient than real machines, and harder to use for
           batch processing.

     Questions
         * How do I install VirtualBox?
     Objectives
         * Download and install VirtualBox, the hypervisor for CMS VMs.
     ***** Helpline *****
     Remember that we are always available to help. Our Mattermost channel
     is open.
***** Downloading VirtualBox *****
VirtualBox is a free, open source and multiplatform hypervisor application to
run virtual machines. The latest version is 6.1.22 and is available for most
platforms at the VirtualBox download site. Note that you will need
administrative permissions on your machine in order to install it.
     The latest tested version of VirtualBox working with this CMS-
     specific CernVM image is 6.1.10. Pick that one if you have troubles
     with the latest version. The full history of VirtualBox versions is
     available on a different_page.
***** Installing VirtualBox *****
     ***** Find your way to install VirtualBox! *****
     Now go ahead with the installation! After you download the appropiate
     installer file, proceed as you would with any other program in your
     system. It shouldnât take long. Afterwards, you can open the
     program, just to test it has been intalled correctly.
          ***** Meet your hypervisor *****
          If installed correctly, after opening the program a window
          similar to this one should emerge:
     ***** Key Points *****
         * To install VirtualBox in your machine (the host), follow the
           installation instructions and run them in your device.

     Questions
         * How do I install the CMS-specific CernVM image?
     Objectives
         * Download and import the CMS CernVM image under VirtualBox .
     ***** Helpline *****
     Remember that we are always available to help. Our Mattermost channel
     is open.
***** Downloading the CMS-specific CernVM image *****
Download the 2011 CMS-specific CernVM image as OVA file from the official
record in the Cern Open Portal site. It is recommended using the version CMS-
OpenData-1.5.3. This VM Image can be used for data from 2011 and 2012, which
are the data we will use in this workshop.
     Make sure to download version of the ova file, 1.5.3. Other versions
     are deprecated.
***** Importing the image into VirtualBox *****
By double clicking the downloaded file, VirtualBox imports the image with
ready-to-run settings. The import could also be triggered directly from the
VirtualBox interface through the File > Import Appliance menu option. But
before that,
     make sure you unselect import hard drives as VDI on the initial
     import screen. Otherwise, it is very likely that the VM wonât boot.
***** Launching the CMS VM *****
After importing, it is likely that you will have to make at least one last
change to the default settings before launching:
     Change the Network settings for adapter 2 from Host-only Adapter to
     NAT.
     Also, check for any Invalid settings detected at the bottom of the
     window after you click on the Settings button, and make the
     appropriate changes following those recommendations.
Finally, launch the CMS-specific CernVM, by clicking on it in the list of VMs
and then on the Start button. It will boot into the graphical user interface
and sets up the CMS environment. Be patient, the first time it will take a
while.
     Note: If you encounter any problems with booting the VM check the
     issues_and_limitations section and/or the_troubleshooting_guide.
If installed correctly, after the import procedure is complete, you will see
something like these screenshots.
     ***** Key Points *****
         * To install the 2011 CMS VM, download the appropriate VM image
           (version 1.5.3), import it into VirtualBox and launch it.

     Questions
         * What is in the CMS VM?
         * How do I test and validate my virtual machine?
     Objectives
         * Learn about the details of the CMS virtual machine
         * Test and validate the CMS VM by running a CMSSW job.
     ***** Helpline *****
     Remember that we are always available to help. Our Mattermost channel
     is open.
***** Know your VM *****
The virtual machine we just installed provides CMS computing environment to be
used with the 2011 and 2012 CMS open data. The virtual machine is based on the
CernVM and uses Scientific Linux CERN. As it was mentioned before, it comes
equipped with the ROOT framework and CMSSW.
An important feature of the VM is the availability of the CernVM_File_System.
Thanks to the cvmfs client installed, the VM gets the CMS software (CMSSW) from
the shared /cvmfs/cms.cern.ch area (physically at CERN but mounted locally) and
the jobs, running on the CMS open data VM, read the conditions data from /
cvmfs/cms-opendata-conddb.cern.ch. Access to the data is through XRootD.
The VM has a 40G virtual hard disk and a 20G cvmfs cache, which is large enough
for condition data for full event range for 2012 data (see the CMS_guide_to_the
condition_database for further details). It has an embedded Scientific Linux
CERN 6 (slc6) shell, where all CMS software specific commands should be
executed. Additionally, it has a CERN Scientific Linux CERN 7 (slc7) shell,
which can be used in the same session.
***** Run a simple demo for testing and validating *****
The validation procedure tests that the CMS environment is installed and
operational on your virtual machine, and that you have access to the CMS Open
Data files. It also access the conditions data from the shared cvmfs area and
caches them. This last action will save us time during the workshop. These
steps also give you a quick introduction to the CMS environment.
In the VM, open a terminal from the CMS Shell icon from the desktop (note that
the X terminal emulator from an icon bottom-left of the VM screen opens a shell
with an operating system incompatible with the CMS software release to be
used).
Execute the following command; this command builds the local release area (the
directory structure) for CMSSW, and only needs to be run once (note that it may
take a while):
cmsrel CMSSW_5_3_32
     Note that if you get a warning message about the current OS being
     SLC7, you are using a wrong terminal. Open a âCMS Shellâ terminal
     as explained above and execute the cmsrel command there.
Change to the CMSSW_5_3_32/src/ directory:
cd CMSSW_5_3_32/src/
Then, run the following command to create the CMS runtime variables:
cmsenv
Create a working directory for the demo analyzer, change to that directory and
create a skeleton for the analyzer:
mkdir Demo
cd Demo
mkedanlzr DemoAnalyzer
Come back to the main src area:
cd ../
Compile the code:
scram b
You can safely ignore the warning.
     IMPORTANT NOTE: Depending on your system, there could be some issues
     with the shared clipboard between the host machine and the virtual
     machine. This means that it is possible that you cannot copy the
     instructions in this episode directly into your VM session. The
     quickest workaround is to use the text_dump_file of the lesson. You
     can download this file directly in your VM, e.g., the wget command,
     and follow along to copy the necessary commands directly from the
     text file.
     ***** Alternative solution to the clipboard problem *****
     Another possibility is to use the ssh and/or scp commands to copy the
     required files to some other machine that you have access to, from
     the VM as well as from the host machine. For instance, if you had
     access to an lxplus computer at cern, you could copy a certain file
     from the VM to the lxplus computer. On the VM you could do:
     scp myfile.txt myusername@lxplus.cern.ch:.
     to copy a hypothetical file myfile.txt to lxplus, and then on the
     host
     scp myusername@lxplus.cern.ch:myfile.txt .
     to copy the same file back to your host machine. Then you can edit
     the file locally and reverse the process to get it back to your VM.
     It could also be possible to have direct access from the host to the
     VM. This youtube_tutorial might be of help for that option.
Before launching the job, letâs modify the configuration file (do not worry,
you will learn about all this stuff in a different lesson) so it is able access
a CMS open data file and cache the conditions data. As it was mentioned, this
will save us time later.
Open the demoanalyzer_cfg.py file using the vi editor (here you can find a good
cheatsheet for that editor). Note that other editors like emacs or nano are
also avilable in the VM.
vi Demo/DemoAnalyzer/demoanalyzer_cfg.py
Replace file:myfile.root with root://eospublic.cern.ch//eos/opendata/cms/
Run2011A/ElectronHad/AOD/12Oct2013-v1/20001/001F9231-F141-E311-8F76-
003048F00942.root to point to an example file.
Chage also the maximum number of events to 10. I.e., change -1to 10 in
process.maxEvents = cms.untracked.PSet( input = cms.untracked.int32(-1)).
In addition, insert, below the PoolSource module, the following lines:
#needed to cache the conditions data
process.load
('Configuration.StandardSequences.FrontierConditions_GlobalTag_cff')
process.GlobalTag.connect = cms.string('sqlite_file:/cvmfs/cms-opendata-
conddb.cern.ch/FT_53_LV5_AN1_RUNA.db')
process.GlobalTag.globaltag = 'FT_53_LV5_AN1::All'
The lines above are intended to access to the condition data, such as the jet-
energy corrections, trigger information, etc. You will learn about them in a
later lesson. Right now it is sufficient to mention that it is a good idea to
cache these data already so later in the workshop we can speed up the
processing.
     ***** Take a look at the final validation config file *****
     At the end, the config file should look like
     import FWCore.ParameterSet.Config as cms
     process = cms.Process("Demo")
     process.load("FWCore.MessageService.MessageLogger_cfi")
     process.maxEvents = cms.untracked.PSet( input = cms.untracked.int32
     (10) )
     process.source = cms.Source("PoolSource",
     # replace 'myfile.root' with the source file you want to use
        fileNames = cms.untracked.vstring(
            'root://eospublic.cern.ch//eos/opendata/cms/Run2011A/
     ElectronHad/AOD/12Oct2013-v1/20001/001F9231-F141-E311-8F76-
     003048F00942.root'
        )
     )
     #needed to cache the conditions data
     process.load
     ('Configuration.StandardSequences.FrontierConditions_GlobalTag_cff')
     process.GlobalTag.connect = cms.string('sqlite_file:/cvmfs/cms-
     opendata-conddb.cern.ch/FT_53_LV5_AN1_RUNA.db')
     process.GlobalTag.globaltag = 'FT_53_LV5_AN1::All'

     process.demo = cms.EDAnalyzer('DemoAnalyzer'
     )

     process.p = cms.Path(process.demo)
Make symbolic links to the conditions database files from cvmfs:
ln -sf /cvmfs/cms-opendata-conddb.cern.ch/FT_53_LV5_AN1_RUNA FT_53_LV5_AN1
ln -sf /cvmfs/cms-opendata-conddb.cern.ch/FT_53_LV5_AN1_RUNA.db
FT_53_LV5_AN1_RUNA.db
and make sure the cms-opendata-conddb.cern.ch directory has actually expanded
in your VM. One way of doing this is executing:
ls -l /cvmfs/
total 18
drwxr-xr-x  8 root root 4096 Jan 13  2014 cernvm-prod.cern.ch
drwxr-xr-x 69  989  984 4096 Aug 29  2014 cms.cern.ch
drwxr-xr-x 14  989  984 4096 Dec 16  2015 cms-opendata-conddb.cern.ch
drwxr-xr-x  4  989  984 4096 May 28  2014 cvmfs-config.cern.ch
Finally, run the cms executable with our configuration (it may really take a
while, but the next time you want to run it will be faster):
